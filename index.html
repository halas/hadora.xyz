  <h2 class="main-info__header">I am front-end developer

    I am geek but not in a "let's buy a new Apple Watch" sense but rather "Wonder how much time would it take
    to setup my own mail server" type. I do love working with technology, solving problems and knowing more
    at the end of the day, than I new at the beginning. So I work as front-end developer. Still junior, but learning
    fast. See some of my projects, learn about my experience, read some of my thoughts.
  </p>
  <p>I am always open for new challenges. Maybe we can work together?</p>

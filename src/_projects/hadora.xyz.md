For quite some time I was looking for occasion to play with
<span class="decorate-word">Jekyll</span>. I love
the idea of static site generators - you can develop static sites in very DRY way
without unnecessary complications of backend code (looking at you, Wordpress!).
On the way of developing this site I decided I want more control over what will
be done with my js and styles, so I familiarized myself with
<span class="decorate-word">webpack</span>.

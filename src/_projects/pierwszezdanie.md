There are people who collect first sentences from good novels. They indeed
tend to be interesting. So I wrote a generator that picks random novel from
Polish collection of public domain
books prepared by [Fundacja Nowoczesna Polska](https://github.com/fnp)
and displays first sentence of it
on the background of the book cover chosen by Nowoczesna Polska's editors.
I used <span class="decorate-word">canvas</span> because I wanted for the
images to be savable.
Some <span class="decorate-word">PHP</span> on the backend with
help of [Radek Czajka](https://github.com/rczajka)
This is project from my amateur developer era and has many flaws, but I like it.

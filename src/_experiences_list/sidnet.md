My task was to resume work on chat module for open source ticketing system [OTRS](https://www.otrs.com/). The work
included the audit of old code, adjusting existing codebase to the new version of OTRS system,
implementation of new functions on back-end (<span class="decorate-word">Perl</span> and
<span class="decorate-word">MySQL</span>) and front-end (Javascript,
JQuery). I successfully moved the chat module from the stage of old and inconsistent code to
working prototype ready to be showcased to customers, learning new programming language
(Perl) on the way.

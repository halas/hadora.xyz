Gazeta Wyborcza is one of the biggest daily newspapers in Poland. I was hired to
work in new and experimental team tasked with finding visually atractive and modern
ways to present journalistic content online while keeping ad department happy
with high pageviews statistics. I developed a slide-show like template used
in many [successful projects](http://warszawa.wyborcza.pl/multimedia/powstanie-w-getcie/).

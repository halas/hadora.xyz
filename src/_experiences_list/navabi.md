[navabi.de](https://navabi.de) premium e-shop with plus size fashion. I am part of ~9 person strong IT team responsible for running custom e-commerce platform. Lot's of work in moving from old legacy code to modern frontend stack. One of my first task was implementation of big redesign of the [itempage](https://www.navabi.de/product/ballonkleid-aus-jersey-31712/?colorcode=2400) - I was proud to not only implement mockups, but reduce page weight and code complexity by around 25% during the process.

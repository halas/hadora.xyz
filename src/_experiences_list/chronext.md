[chronext.de](https://chronext.de) is a premium watch e-commerce. My task was to move frontend code base into
modern tech stack. I removed bootstrap, replaced gulp with <span class="decorate-word">webpack</span>webpack, introduced autmated tests with <span class="decorate-word">Jest</span> and basic <span class="decorate-word">Progressive Web App</span> functionality. I worked on internal Vue.js application.

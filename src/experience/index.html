    I have <span class="experience-count">{{ site.experienceStartDate | timeago }}</span> of
    commercial front-end developer experience with 6 years of project and PR management in
    the company running one of the biggest Polish web sites. Even before I decided to switch
    to technical site of the business, I learnt a lot about technology. Good communication skills
    and understanding of broader business context help in developer career as well.

    I am geek but not in a "let's buy a new Apple Watch" sense but rather
    "Wonder how much time would it take
    to setup my own mail server" type. I do love working with technology,
    solving problems and knowing more
    at the end of the day, than I new at the beginning.

  <p>
    So I work as front-end developer. Still junior, but learning
    fast. Read about my <a class="decorate-word" href="/experience">experience</a>.
    See some of my <a class="decorate-word" href="/projects">projects</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am always open for new challenges.
    Maybe we can work <span class="decorate-word">together?<span>
